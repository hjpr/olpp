At the end of the Delta wave near the last half of 2021, the hospital I worked for sent out a unit-by-unit survey moderated by a large analytics company. On the surface the goal seemed to be polling sentiment about managers, workplace safety, staffing hours, etc. Having off-beat senses of humor, after taking the surveys many of us in our ICU laughed about the surveys offering us the suicide hotline and other resources due to our low scores. We were all interested to see how our unit compared to other units as we were exhausted, overworked, and generally hilariously mentally taxed from our experiences over the past year. We were all morbidly excited to have our feelings validated that this whole thing was a total clusterfuck like we had been griping about. It was pretty frustrating for everyone to be on the same page about what was wrong, but for some reason the administration seemed to do everything but what we asked for.

The plan was for the hospital to release the survey around October, but lo and behold, when the date finally arrived the hospital sent out information that the survey results were staying with the managers who were "determining the best strategy to release that information to nursing staff." As of writing this, according to my coworkers, those results were never shared (at least openly or to their knowledge). I always felt like that situation exemplified how administration controls information to adjust both the public facing perspective of the hospital, but also to shape internal perspectives. I would call that gaslighting, but I'm sure HR/PR has a term for it incorporating the word "strategy" somewhere.

This is a small example of an overwhelming bank of experiences I've accumulated both personally and anecdotally where it's astoundingly clear that nurse sentiment only plays into hospital policy when something like turnover hits a magic bad number, or budgets are broken from relying too heavily on travelers (and pray tell why staff won't stay?). Nursing speaks the language of human experience; hospitals speak the language of consumer sentiment and the bottom line.

## The idea.

Why let the hospital control information? What's the concern with having openly accessible information in the public domain? The reality is that no organization wants to share information if it isn't positive. Since there aren't centralized systems where you can compare salaries, check interest, read experiences and reviews, then a system needs to be created. We are rising to meet that challenge, and more.

### To create an actionable solution, we need actionable intelligence.

Nurses use many different platforms to communicate, but none are built for persistence. What I mean is that when you take a cursory glance at how nurses receive information and answer questions, content gets buried naturally as other conversations ebb and flow. Social media by design is meant to fuel engagement (for advertisers of course), so it's no wonder that anyone looking for information can't simply use Google and instead has to re-ask the same question that may have been answered many times before. Our system is standardized and persistent. If you take the time to provide information in the form of a report it will still exist, be relevant, and applicable for the years to come

### Standardized and Persistent.

So, what does "standardized" mean? It means our reporting tool asks for information in 4 categories - staffing, assignment, facility, and experience (SAFE). This system concisely categorizes the many points of data into easy-to-understand groupings. Staffing deals with ratios and acuity. Assignment categorizes the type of unit and the overall unit-level sentiment. Facility encompasses the various dimensions of the hospital you work for. Experience is a catch all category for PTO/scheduling issues, burnout, and intent to find other work. These reports are aggregated and displayed to other users anonymously to build a massive network of information to help new graduates, staff nurses, travel nurses, and temporary/PRN staff compare hospitals by salary, experience in various dimensions, schedule flexibility, and others. 

Persistent means that this information lives on in the aggregation. If you spend five minutes of your precious time submitting a report, you can be guaranteed that someone looking at your hospital system or unit will benefit directly from the information you provide.

### So, what now?

Our tool at safernursing.com should be released around late January to early February 2023 as a beta test before the full release in the middle of 2023. We set up the safernursing.org site as a way to rally funding and disseminate information for future development on the travel tools and research portal (look for articles here soon). Take a second and bookmark "safernursing.com", "safernursing.org", follow our social media (links at the bottom of the .org site), interact with our Mastodon instance at "safernursing.social", and contribute any amount that you can (either at the .org, or subscribe here) as we forge ahead to create these large-scale tools.

Thanks for engaging. See you on rounds
