Causing patients harm is one of the biggest concerns that most new nurses have as they exit the safety of their controlled labs onto the chaos of the hospital floor. The "five rights" is a system taught in nursing schools to try to ensure that wrong meds aren't passed, but does using that system ensure that no med errors are committed? An article by the AACN would support my opinion that the five rights is a good place to start, but ultimately hospital systems are responsible for policies which create good practices to prevent med errors.

>“To be clear, nurses and other practitioners cannot be held accountable for achieving the five rights; they can only be held accountable for following the processes that their organizations have designed and held out as the best way to verify the five rights.” ISMP went on to say, “Adding a sixth, seventh, or eighth right (e.g., right reason, right drug information, right line attachment) is not the answer, either.”

Hospitals can create good practices like having standardized order sets, pharmacists on rounds, reducing overrides, clear labeling, and EHR/MAR control, but how do nurses outside of being told exactly how to prepare meds not pass the wrong one?

### Setting yourself up for success.

Most of us remember how we were taught the five rights, but do nurses really check every single medication methodically before it's administered? In our own ways, of course! See, every nurse probably does this different, but nurses create their own flow (within hospital policy) that allows fast but accurate verification. Good nurses are constantly verifying that the meds they have are correct and appropriate, but it may not always be the way that it's taught in nursing school. I'll share with you the way I do it so you can see an example and incorporate other appropriate methods into your flow.

### A system of accuracy.

*Checking starts when you go to pull your meds.* I never assume that anything in the dispenser is correct. Pharmacy may have stocked the wrong thing in the wrong bin, or a med from another bin could have been dropped/scooted into a neighboring bin. I select my meds to pull and then as I'm pulling, ensure it's the one I expect.

*Verify your patient.* Some modern health records let you have different patients across tabs up at the same time, so don't assume you are looking at the right patient's MAR. Check the name of the MAR against the patient's wristband.

*Don't scan all your meds at the same time.* It's tempting to scan all the meds you want to give and then open them all up, but it encourages you to move quickly through the MAR. Slowing down and scanning each one as I prepare them is another check. This confirms patient/drug/route for the second time, and dose/time for the first. The most common med error can be caught here, where you gave a 25 mg tab but only were supposed to give 12.5 mg. Scanning all your meds at the same time means you may treat all the meds the same, e.g., popping them out whole/drawing up the entire contents into a syringe. By slowing down you force yourself to see partial doses and prepare those doses appropriately at the time that you scan the med. When (not if) you get distracted in the middle of giving meds, those prepared doses are accurate where you may have forgotten to split a pill or draw up 1/4 syringe otherwise. I can't stress this section enough, that when most nurses commit med errors, it is of this type.

*Label syringes!* No unlabeled flushes or syringes in the room. Right after I pull up a medication I administer it, or I tape the vial to the syringe with that clear durapore tape so I can still see the label.

*No talking with the patient or family when scanning and preparing meds.* If I walk into the room and am having a conversation with anyone, I ask to pause the conversation so we can resume after I'm finished giving meds. Yes, really. I find the most crucial point of focus needs to be that final check right before crushing/passing/hanging.

*Overconfidence is a silent killer.* If you are a new grad that prides themselves on not needing to ask as many questions as your co-new grads, let this be your reality check. The new nurses that move slow and ask questions at first, will run circles around you in a year. Taking the time to learn your way around medications will give you that Spidey-sense that more experienced nurses talk about. If you expect to give one thing and your experience tells you that something is off, trust that gut feeling. If you don't have a gut feeling yet, the way you get it is repetition. RaDonda Vaught's mistake of giving vecuronium instead of Versed would have never happened on our unit, as all of our experienced nurses are very familiar with the process of administering both meds. Versed doesn't need to be reconstituted with saline, so quickly pulling a vial of white powder that was supposed to be Versed wouldn't have just set off alarm bells, it would have set off a whole ass foghorn. If you've never done something before, how could you be expected to know? So, err on the side of "looking stupid" now to save yourself from the overconfident you in the future. I ask questions all the time even on stuff I'm pretty familiar with just to be sure I'm not totally off-base.

### Other techniques.

Modeled after the sterile cockpit model of professional pilots, the "no interruption zone" technique is the idea of a red box/designated area around the med dispensing station which alerts nurses to focus solely on pulling medications without any distractions. According to evidence-based practices this reduces med errors by creating a culture of focus and awareness around med administration.

The limitations of the above study include challenging the feasibility of maintaining an actual red taped zone to prep meds (to which I agree), so I choose to follow the spirit of the paper rather than the explicit methods in which they garnered results. My "no interruption zone" starts when I pull my medications out in the room to administer them and ends when I have completed and cleaned/organized the area post-admin. According to evidence, it's obviously best practice to not have conversations around the dispenser, but I really only have a hard "don't talk to me" rule in the room.

### Learning from mistakes.

Most nurses have made a med error at one time, but only a few nurses have made the kind of med error that newer nurses are petrified to commit. Trying to learn a fool-proof step-by-step method to not pass the wrong med doesn't acknowledge the often chaotic and disorganized state of hospital units. The points above try to help you get that there are specific times you are most prone to making mistakes, and how one nurse attempts to minimize those.

Via AACN -

>"Multiple factors contribute to medication errors, including nurse’s workload, time of day, experience level, transcription errors, and system deficiencies. Kane-Gill and Weber reported that most medication errors in critical care settings occur during the prescribing and administering phases of medication delivery. In a mixed methods study of the effect of interruptions on nurses’ cognitive work, medication administration took up 17% of the nurses’ time and each nurse averaged 30 interruptions per shift."

We all need quiet to focus, but how much and when is up to your professional judgement. Understanding when other nurses are prone to making mistakes can help you find a starting point for creating your own system. Also, enjoy the process! You are working towards synthesizing all the things you've learned into something that works for your brain and that can be incredibly rewarding.
