So, you've read about how the main tool will aggregate data (The SAFE Nursing Web Tool. A Prelude), but I teased that there are more functionalities down the pipeline once the main tool is refined post-beta. I have two major modules that will integrate cleanly into the website. Those two major modules are the "Travel Tool" and the "Research Portal."

### Travel Tool

After the main web tool release mid-year 2023, the travel tool will get handed off to our developers to provide extended functionality to all traveling bedside nurses. Not only will you be able to compare hospitals, but you can do so knowing the median rates, duration of contract, and agencies giving the best offers. This is a comprehensive system that will enable you to understand how to ultimately choose the best contract for you based on how you prioritize pay vs hospital experience. This is such an exciting tool for me to bring to the table and I wish I could bring it with the main launch. Consider subscribing here at OLPP and/or contributing any amount at safernursing.org to help me speed up the development cycle!

### Research Portal

One massive project that is designed but not yet prototyped is a tool meant to link nurses, specific hospital/unit experience, and affordable nurse research. In 2021-2022 when I was looking at the major contributing factors to burnout, I read consistently about how complicated the issue is due to significant reported variation. I noticed patterns where the study organizers used many different nurses from many hospitals. This practice is standard to ensure a diverse study group but creates chaos in extrapolating data which can be used to target interventions. Burnout is incredibly complicated and can often be heavily influenced by work environment. Obviously, something like COVID burnout due to a pandemic is shared across the profession (and will pop out of the data), but more subtle issues like scheduling flexibility, not honoring PTO requests, and heavy work burdens from incentivized overtime are much more difficult to extract from the noise. By allowing researchers to access data which can be grouped by system, hospital, or unit, easier correlations can be drawn, and more tailored solutions constructed.

### Democratization

Tech companies always tout their products as being good for consumers, but when was the last time you used a nursing product that was actually built for you rather than the hospital? For me, the answer is never and that's why I decided to build the Safer Nursing family of projects.
As other module ideas are refined, I'll update this list. You can rest assured that any developments will never benefit hospitals at the expense of nurses and will only add to your ability to plan your career and find the perfect balance of factors you need for real workplace satisfaction.
