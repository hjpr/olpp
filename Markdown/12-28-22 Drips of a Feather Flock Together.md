I had a realization after spending countless hours memorizing tons of selected drug characteristics in Pharmacology class. Why memorize all these properties when I could use a pocket guide, or online monographs?

There's clearly a point to monotonously memorizing drug lists, but it brings up a few interesting ways to think about learning and organizing your thoughts. Turns out, nursing school doesn't make you a nurse, it just prepares you to learn how to become the nurse you need to be for your specialty. If you can learn fifty drugs thoroughly over the course of three months, you can certainly learn the fifty most commonly seen drugs on your unit. Of course, you'll remember things you were taught in school, but there's a reason why most new grads feel more comfortable as a flower on a wall than in the thick of the action. It's knowledge plus experience that solidifies the ability to rattle off important details like it's second nature.

### Running drips like a pro.

Knowing action, mechanism, onset, peak, duration, and compatibility are crucial for running IVs confidently. When you orient on your unit, you'll probably get (or have already gotten) a list of the most commonly used drips. This is the not-so-subtle hint that this particular list is important to read and understand. A piece of the puzzle that probably isn't included, however, is compatibility with one another. Drugs can be incompatible in a number of different ways ranging from physical crystallization to chemical changes. Keeping it all together and organized in your head can be difficult. It's especially tricky when you have multiple drips running and have to hang a bunch of new ones because your patient starts crashing.

### General rules.

Understanding some simple rules can be helpful to efficiently organizing your IV's. You'll probably discover your own simple rules because your unit will have a certain pattern to the kind of drips that they run. It will be important to know, for example, that sodium bicarbonate and pressors are incompatible because they are very frequently run at the same time. Each specialty and unit will have their own sets of drips you'll learn to group together. Here's a generic breakdown after observing some overall patterns.

**Most common pressors can run together.**

For our acutely decompensating septic patients we could have norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine, and phenylephrine all going through a single lumen of a CVC. While not as commonly used on my unit, dobutamine and dopamine are also all compatible.

**Most common sedation can run together.**

Fentanyl, midazolam, hydromorphone, ketamine, and morphine are ok to run. Paralytics require sedation and are also compatible. Usually there's a max of two sedatives running so it makes it easy to remember. The only time you might see these all at the same time is trying to sedate King Kong.

**Check compatibilities for antibiotics.**

Five minutes isn't life or death with antibiotics, so there's always a few minutes to pull up Trissel's/Lexicomp/Micromedex. Where you'll encounter the most issues with incompatibilities are running antibiotics (especially that pesky Lactated Ringer's) so always take the time to research if you aren't sure.

### Venous Access.

Managing drips with patients who have poor access will be a challenge for you, but hopefully the nurses around you will help you find more access as needed. Our patients end up getting lined when they decompensate, so our access is usually a triple-lumen CVC, and one or two PIVs. Our CVCs have three lumens, so commonly one lumen is for pressors, one lumen is for sedation, and one KVO lumen is for antibiotics. Our one or two PIVs would then get used for our drips that needed to be run alone, or so we could run two antibiotics at the same time. Sometimes you are in the thick of it with limited options and need to get creative. Especially during a code, consider asking the PA/NP/MD to drill an intraosseous catheter if your access is super sketchy or may prevent you from getting pressors in.

### Common drugs to run alone.

Listed below are the kinds of drugs that have the potential to make you do the IV shuffle. As each of these are picky about what they are run with, it may take some finagling to get them all running without a hitch.

Insulin - Incompatibilities. With protocols requiring titrating based on blood sugars, you'll want a consistent flow rate. Some nurses will even run a KVO alongside insulin when the rates are slower.
Heparin - Incompatibilities. In a tight squeeze, some things can be run with heparin so it's not a total no-go.

Furosemide - Incompatibilities. Furosemide is very pH sensitive, so will crystallize readily in the presence of many other solutions.

Amiodarone - Incompatibilities. Amiodarone specifically can't be run with insulin, heparin, or furosemide. Like the youngest brother of four, it doesn't get along with anyone in this solo solution family.

Sodium Bicarbonate - Incompatibilities. When you have a patient on bicarb, you've probably got a lot of drips going, so this one can be tricky to find an open line.
Many other drugs that you'll see listed for incompatibilities are drugs which are intermittently infused through your KVO. It's much easier to manage your KVO meds by arranging the order they run to get them all in.

### A limited access scenario.

Let's set up a small scenario you may find yourself in. You have a patient who is in septic shock. For access they have no PIVs due to terrible vasculature, a triple-lumen CVC with pressors in one lumen, sedation in the second lumen, and a KVO running with an antibiotic. You have a scheduled push of pantoprazole which is incompatible with the running antibiotic (1 hr left), and no other access. How do you give this pantoprazole properly? Let's assume that pantoprazole is compatible with the pressors/sedation, what lumen would you use for the push?

It's kind of a trick question because there really is no hospital policy that says you can't use the pressor or sedation lines for your PRNs. This is why nurses use the phrase best practices instead of only practices. When shit really hits the fan, knowing how far you can bend best practices in the name of time-critical actions is super important. Nursing is both an art and a science, and critically understanding the consequences to all of your actions will elevate your nursing practice.
In this instance, as pantoprazole is neither life nor death, I'd use a half-flush pre-medication into the KVO followed by a half-flush post-medication. Using two full 10 ml flushes isn't a problem but depending on the number of IV medications you have to give, this can help cut down on the amount of fluid your patient gets via flushes.

In a similar scenario, but your patient is crashing, the doc tells you to push 1/2 of a phenylephrine stick because their MAP is 40. Which lumen can you use? "I thought you weren't supposed to flush a line with pressors in it," you say. You bet you can go for the pressor line because you know for a fact phenyl will be compatible and you don't have to stop and check. Using your nursing judgement, you know that the extra pressor they are getting from that flush won't hurt the situation.

Sometimes the small details make big differences in how smoothly you can get things done. Also, remember to cultivate that positive teamwork culture so when things get dicey and you start drowning, there's always someone who can step in with an extra pair of hands.
