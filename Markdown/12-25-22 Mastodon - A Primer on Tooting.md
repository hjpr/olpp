You don't have to be a contrarian to understand why moving away from corporate social media is a net positive. You may have read Mastodon: Our micro-blogging alternative to doom scrolling article about why I think Mastodon will be an advantageous alternate to shaping conversations away from Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/LinkedIn. You followed our invite link and signed up, but now you are sitting in an unfamiliar screen with a blank feed. Something feels eerily off from the dopamine fueled hamster wheel you just came from, and it feels disturbing but also...calm? That's right friend, take a deep breath and notice the lack of sponsored tweets and manufactured outrage. Welcome to your Mastodon.

### Basic Layout.

Like Twitter, you post from the left column in the white box. Unlike Twitter, "tweets" are now "toots" (go ahead, laugh, get it all out) and that 160-character limit is extended to 500. The middle lighter grey column is where your, and other toots will be displayed. The right column you can think about like tabs. In the image above, the Explore tab is selected (in blue) but because we currently don't have a ton of user engagement Mastodon doesn't think that any topic is trending. You may be used to seeing trending topics from across the internet on your home Twitter feed, but here Explore relates to your local server trending topics instead. Mastodon isn't built around advertising so if you don't have local users intentionally posting with hashtags, you don't receive any trending content.

### Mastodon Tabs.

Let's take a closer look at tabs. Most of the tabs are self-explanatory, but what may require some clarity is Mastodon's unique separation between Local and Federated content. As explained in our article referenced at the top, safernursing.social is your Local content and the Fediverse (aka, the other independently operated servers) is your Federated content. This allows you to filter what comes in depending on what you want to engage with. If you only want to see your Local friends and keep the conversation more focused, you'll select the Local tab. Conversely, if you want to see any accounts you follow from other servers and their boosted activity, you'll select the Federated tab. This is akin to original Facebook (hereafter known as "Cool Facebook") where social feeds were only generated off of your friends, and friends of friends.

### Following your first friend.

All my friends are nice, so to learn how to follow accounts I'll show you how to friend (follow) me. My username is @J, but remember, my actual username is @J@safernursing.social because I signed up via our safernursing.social Mastodon. Once you've created your account, type in @J@safernursing.social to your search bar...

...and you will see my name pop up. I'm on my own account here, so I can't friend myself, but you will see the icon to click on your screen. Also notice how when I'm on my screen it hides @safernursing.social because it knows I'm on my home Mastodon instance. Let's say you wanted to follow a specific account on the mastodon.social instance @imoldgregg. You would search @imoldgregg@mastodon.social and use the icon to follow. There are easier ways to follow while exploring other instances, but this assumes you found their Mastodon username on Twitter or something similar.

### Let the content flow!

Well, more like a dribble right off the bat, but the point is that having an empty page is boring...you want excitement! First step, follow me @J and @Nursebot to have a solid base of good content. @Nursebot is a bot I set up (on my home server) to retweet curated content such as current research papers/topics of nursing interest from high-quality Twitter accounts. I am always open to adding new feeds to the bot, just DM me or send an email to the support account listed on @Nursebot's profile.

You can start inviting in more content through your Federated tab by finding interesting accounts on other decentralized servers. Some very large and popular servers right now are...
There are also server lists on Servers - Mastodon, but many of them are special interest and you may need to apply to access them. That's the beauty! Communities can be as open or closed as they'd like.

### A last note on interacting.

One more category to understand is how to interact with your friends/followers' toots. Each toot has a list of ways to interact at the bottom.

From left to right you can reply, boost, favorite, bookmark, or share. All of these are similar to Twitter, with boost essentially the "re-tweet" and favorite the "like" feature.

Now that you've gotten a handle on the basics, update your profile, and send out a #introduction first post. You can then pin that post to make sure that people who view your profile can get a sense for who you are. Check out my profile to see an example.
Happy Tooting!
