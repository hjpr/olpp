As a tech enthusiast, I like keeping up with trends in tech to build my toolset for potential novel applications. One recent viral newsworthy item has been the release of the ChatGPT bot, a development of the OpenAI project. OpenAI is also involved in other recent viral developments you may have seen if you've seen DALL-E artwork on your social feeds. If you aren't familiar with how AI is generated, an algorithm is trained on a set of data which creates a large mathematical map to predict the most likely words to follow based on the previous words. The results that other users were getting were pretty incredible. I had some dying questions to ask the collected texts to see what would happen with nursing prompts.

### A Question.

I asked....
As an overworked bedside nurse during the COVID pandemic, how would you go about enacting change within hospitals to improve working conditions?

### The Response.

*As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I don't have personal experience working as a bedside nurse during the COVID pandemic. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to enact change within hospitals to improve working conditions.
One potential approach would be to gather support from your colleagues and form a union or professional organization to advocate for better working conditions. This can provide a collective voice for nurses and other healthcare workers, and can help to put pressure on hospital administration to make necessary changes.
Another approach would be to work with hospital administration directly to identify areas where working conditions can be improved, and to develop a plan to address those issues. This can involve conducting surveys or focus groups to gather input from nurses and other healthcare workers, and then using that information to develop solutions that can be implemented by the hospital.
Ultimately, the key to enacting change within hospitals is to advocate for better working conditions in a persistent and organized manner. This may involve working with others to form a united front, and engaging in dialogue with hospital administration to find solutions that benefit both nurses and the hospital as a whole.

### The Real Question.

For an AI that doesn't think, I'd say it did a pretty good job of catching the sentiment that many others have written about. The real test though, can it answer the most controversial question in all of modern healthcare?

Why do nurses not like the phrase "healthcare heroes."

### The Response.

*There could be several reasons why nurses may not like the phrase "healthcare heroes." Some nurses may feel that the term oversimplifies the work they do, and that it does not adequately recognize the complex and demanding nature of their profession. Others may feel that the term places too much emphasis on individual achievement and does not adequately acknowledge the team effort that is required to provide effective healthcare.
Additionally, some nurses may feel that the term "healthcare heroes" is used to deflect attention away from the systemic issues that affect their profession, such as inadequate staffing levels, low pay, and unsafe working conditions. In this sense, the term "healthcare heroes" may be seen as a way to put the burden of solving these problems on individual nurses, rather than addressing the underlying causes.
Overall, it is important to recognize that nurses, like all healthcare workers, are dedicated professionals who deserve respect and support for the important work they do. Using terms like "healthcare heroes" can be a way to show appreciation for their efforts, but it is also important to listen to their concerns and address the challenges they face in their profession.

### In Conclusion.

Understanding why this AI text output is poignant may require a small explanation as a key point isn't as obvious. AI works by predicting the next most probable word to come after other words given the context of a prompt. This means that when an AI is given information, it forms a large web of probabilities based on exactly what was fed into it via the training text.

An AI "understanding" why nurses don't like being called healthcare heroes is simply because enough information exists out in the general sphere to create those predictive results. To me, the fact that "healthcare heroes" is still being tossed around by administration is another sign that they continue to remain profoundly disconnected from the bedside, and in contrast to how progressive conversations around nursing issues are being held.
